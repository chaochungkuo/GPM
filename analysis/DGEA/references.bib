               short reads, which can be used to produce accurate but
               fragmented genome assemblies. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford
               Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long
               reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the
               sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is
               significant interest in combining data from these complementary
               sequencing technologies to generate more accurate ``hybrid''
               assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the
               benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short
               reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we
               present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes
               from a combination of short and long reads, which produces
               assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective.
               Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads
               using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph
               using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a
               novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly
               graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can
               assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other
               hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are

  abstract  = "SUMMARY: Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to
               dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A
               number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed,
               but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing
               methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new
               assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating
               assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been
               adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality
               assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies.
               This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with
               new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies
               both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference.
               QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help
               scientists in their research and in their publications. In this
               study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on
               three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are
               available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive
               versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.
