# Method description

Raw data was demultiplexed with cellranger mkfastq (10x Genomics v7.1.0) to generate fastq files for both GEX and VDJ libraries. The fastq files were then analyzed by the cellranger multi with default parameters. This report was generated using custom scripts in R version 4.2.2. 

# Reports of Cellranger multi for GEX and VDJ

```{r load, echo=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
samples <- list.dirs(path = DIR_multi_output, full.names = F, recursive = F)
summaryFiles <- vector(mode="list", length=length(samples))
names(summaryFiles) <- samples
for (i in 1:length(samples)) {
  summaryFiles[[i]] <- paste0(DIR_multi_output_published,samples[[i]],"/outs/web_summary.html")
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
for( i in 1:length(samples)){
  cat("\n")
  cat("## ", "[",samples[[i]],"]","(",summaryFiles[[i]],")\n", sep="") # Create links to the
  cat("\n")
}
