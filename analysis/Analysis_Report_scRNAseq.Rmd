# Method description

FASTQ files were generated using cellranger mkfastq (10x Genomics). The generated FASTQ files are analyzed by nfcore/scrnaseq pipeline (version 2.1.0) with cellranger aligner. This report was generated using custom scripts in R version 4.2.2. 

# Reports of cellranger

```{r load, echo=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
samples <- list.dirs(path = DIR_count, full.names = F, recursive = F)
summaryFiles <- vector(mode="list", length=length(samples))
names(summaryFiles) <- samples
for (i in 1:length(samples)) {
  summaryFiles[[i]] <- paste0(DIR_count_published,samples[[i]],"/outs/web_summary.html")
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
for( i in 1:length(samples)){
  cat("\n")
  cat("## ", "[",samples[[i]],"]","(",summaryFiles[[i]],")\n", sep="") # Create links to the
  cat("\n")
}
