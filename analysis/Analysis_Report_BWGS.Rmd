The following contents are provided after the basic assembly analysis of the bacterial whole genome sequencing data with Bacass pipeline[@Peltzer2021-xn] under nf-core framework[@Ewels2020-il] :

- Quality reports of the sequencing data
- Contamination check reports for the samples
- Assenbly results
- Assembly quality assessment reports for the samples
- Annotation of the assembled genome

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quality report of the sequencing data

The raw sequencing data were demultiplexed. QC assessment was applied on the resulted fastq files. Bellow is the resulted multiQC[@Ewels2016-pr] report:

[MultiQC reports](GPM_URL_3_Reports/multiqc/multiqc_report.html)

# Contamination check

The raw data from a genome sequencing could contain DNA from contaminating organisms. In this step, sequencing results were scanned using metagenomic analysis tool Kraken2[@Wood2019-er] to identify potential contamination.

# Genome Assembly

Unicycler[@Wick2017-us] was applied to assemble the short sequencing reads. The assembled scaffolds fasta files are listed bellow:

[Assembled scaffolds](GPM_URL_2_Processed_data/assembly)

# Assembly quality assessment

The quality of the assembled contigs were evaluated by QUAST[@Gurevich2013-tw] with the following report:

# Annotation the assembled genome

The assemblies are annotated by Prokka[@Seemann2014-ic].
