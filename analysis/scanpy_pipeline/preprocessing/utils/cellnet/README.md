scTab
=======
De novo cell type prediction model for single-cell RNA-seq data that can be trained across a large-scale collection of 
curated datasets.

Model checkpoints and traning data
-----
* Training data (compatible with Merlin Dataloader infrastructure): https://pklab.med.harvard.edu/felix/data/merlin_cxg_2023_05_15_sf-log1p.tar.gz (164GB) 
* Model checkpoints: https://pklab.med.harvard.edu/felix/data/scTab-checkpoints.tar.gz (8.1GB)
* Minimal subset of the training, validation and test data: https://pklab.med.harvard.edu/felix/data/merlin_cxg_2023_05_15_sf-log1p_minimal.tar.gz (0.5GB)

Installation
------------

### Installation via Nvidia Enroot / Docker (easy)
A base docker image with most packages preinstalled can be pulled from here: 
nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-pytorch:23.02

Moreover, the Nvidia Enroot (https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) container image which was used to run all the experiments 
in this paper can be found to download here: https://pklab.med.harvard.edu/felix/data/merlin-2302.sqsh

For ease of use, we recommend to use the above supplied Enroot container image as it comes with all relevant software 
preinstalled.

### Installation via pip
Run the following command the project folder to install the ``cellnet`` package:
``pip install -e .``

To install GPU dependencies install the dependencies from the ``requirements-gpu.txt`` file first. 
To do so, use ``--extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com/`` argument when installing packages via pip.

Installation time on a local computer should be a couple of minutes.

System requirements
------------
Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (used OS version)\
Python version: 3.8 or 3.10\
Packages: See requirements.txt and requirements-gpu.txt

Hardware requirements
------------
Due to high computational demands, a modern GPU (e.g. Nvidia A100 or V100 GPU with at least 16GB of VRAM) is needed to 
run the training and evaluation scripts in this repository.\
On a normal desktop computer without GPU acceleration runtime will probably exceed several days.
